# CalProt (SPA for calculating protein and calorie intake)

This is a website you can use to track your calorie and protein intake. There's some other additional features explained further below.

## Calorie and Protein Tracking

Input your meal information each day and get an overview

## Activity Tracking

Along with calories and protein you can also input your daily activities and calories burned through them

## Goal Setter

You can also set your calorie and protein goal. In the near future I will incorporate an easy to use goal calculator.

## Date Selection and Backtracking

You can select a date and look at your statistics of said day.

- Click on the Calendar month selector and select a month.
- After that you can click on any date to view your stats of the day.
